### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Joey Gallotta. I'm a software technical writer with a strong background in software development, computer science, and agile project management. Iâ€™m highly experienced in developing technical user guides, developer documentation, troubleshooting guides, API references, release notes, sample code, and engineering diagrams. My passion for collaboration and continuous learning allows me to quickly adapt to new technology and produce high-quality technical documentation.
